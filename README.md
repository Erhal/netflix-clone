# Netflix clone application:

The "Netflix clone" application is a web application developed using React, TypeScript, React Router, and Axios.<br/>
The application has a main page, registration page, login page, and movie page for authenticated users. <br/>

Features of the application:

* Registration and authorization using a local Node.js server.
* Saving the JWT token in localStorage.
* Displaying a page with movies for authorized users.

Some elements are non-functional, for example, the buttons in the header on the movies page were added for appearance only. However, you can sign out from this page by hovering over the account icon and clicking 'Sign out of Netflix'.

The project and server can be started with a single command: `npm run start`.<br/>
The application will be run on port **'3000'** and the server will be run on port **'3001'**.
